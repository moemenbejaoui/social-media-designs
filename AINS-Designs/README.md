# First Design Attempts – AINS Visuals

These are my first tries at designing, made for the **Artificial Intelligence National Summit (AINS)**. Just messing around with layouts, colors, and making things look decent while learning the basics.  

## What’s in Here

### **AINS Recruiting Post**  
A social media post to recruit people for a few roles:  
- Project Manager  
- Sponsoring Manager  
- Technical Manager  
- Program Manager  

The goal was to make the roles clear and the post easy to read, while keeping it visually simple.

### **Form Header**  
A header for an online form for the summit. Just a minimal, clean design to make the form look nicer.

## Tools Used  
- Canva  

## Why This Repo Exists  
Mostly just to keep track of my first designs and see how much I improve over time.
